# Federated Learning for Aircraft Anomaly Detection

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of **Federated Learning (FL)** for detecting anomalies in aircraft engine performance. The system simulates a fleet of aircraft, where each generates its own dataset of engine metrics, including attributes like engine RPM, fuel flow, temperature, and vibration levels. 

These datasets are shared across a **peer-to-peer network** to enable collaborative learning while preserving data privacy. The project lays the groundwork for using **autoencoders** and **federated algorithms** for anomaly detection in distributed systems.
